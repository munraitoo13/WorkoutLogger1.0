### This is a small project just to improve my basics python learning ###
- With this, you can log all your runnings and walks by kilometers or miles and date, so you can keep track of your physical activity.

## How to install it? ##
```
git clone https://github.com/munraitoo13/workoutlogger1.0/
```
## How to use it? ##
- First of all, run it on your terminal.
- After that, the usage is very intuitive, just type the number of the option on the menu and hit enter, after that just complete the remaining inputs, and done!
The output will be sent to the WorkoutLogger1.0.txt file, that is located on the same place the python file is.
